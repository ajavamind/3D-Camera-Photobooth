# Photobooth Configuration file for Canon SELPHY CP1300

The photobooth print command line has a 
rotate left because the gallery photobooth web interface does not keep autorotate EXIF information when it moves images to its data\print directory.

IrfanView application command lines

"C:\Program Files\IrfanView\i_view64.exe" %s /rotate_l  /print="Canon SELPHY CP1300" /ini="C:\CP1300"
"C:\Program Files\IrfanView\i_view64.exe" %s /rotate_l  /print="Canon MX470 series Printer"
